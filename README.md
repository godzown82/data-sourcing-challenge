# data-sourcing-challenge
This Challenge has three parts, and was done in the following order: 

* Part 1: Access the New York Times API. 

* Part 2: Access The Movie Database API.

* Part 3: Merge and Clean the Data for Export.
  * the exported file is mymoviedb.csv

In order to run this code you will have to create your own ".env" to store your API keys needed for the New York Times API and Movie Database API. Then set your env_path to where you stored your .env file
